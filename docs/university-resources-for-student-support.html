<p>Case Western Reserve University has a wide range of student support resources on campus. These resources can assist students both in the classroom and outside of it. CWRU offers these resources to enrich and enhance each student’s academic experience and to create an environment that encourages personal growth and development. We provide a detailed list (also available at the website of the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences) below. For each resource, we also list contact information including a website where you can learn more. Please take advantage of these resources.</p>
<div id="cwru-care-virtual-mental-health" class="section level2" number="8.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> CWRU CARE (Virtual Mental Health)</h2>
<p>A new initiative, <a href="https://case.edu/studentlife/healthcounseling/counseling-services/cwru-care-virtual-counseling-visits">CWRU Care</a>, is meant to help ensure that students living beyond our state can access mental health care from providers familiar with university students’ unique needs. More, it will increase students’ opportunities to connect quickly with counselors regarding specific issues-and, we hope, provide additional flexibility in scheduling regular sessions. As with services our university counseling staff provide, your sessions and interactions with CWRU Care are free of charge to you.</p>
<p>Those who live in Ohio continue to have the option to access care through <a href="https://case.edu/studentlife/healthcounseling/counseling-services">University Counseling Services</a>, but also are eligible to use <a href="https://case.edu/studentlife/healthcounseling/counseling-services/cwru-care-virtual-counseling-visits">CWRU Care</a>. Those outside Ohio can contact our counseling services 24/7 at 216.368.5872 either for emergency care or to seek assistance in identifying a qualified provider where they live. Alternatively, they can connect with providers using CWRU Care. More information is <a href="https://case.edu/studentlife/healthcounseling/counseling-services/cwru-care-virtual-counseling-visits">available here about CWRU Care</a>.</p>
<p>Students living abroad are only able to access short-term assistance (e.g. when connected quickly with a provider to talk that day about an issue) through CWRU Care. Regularly scheduled sessions are not an option for those outside the U.S.</p>

<p>The Office of Student Affairs provides programs, facilities, and services that extend and enhance the student experience at Case. Office members work to collaborate actively with students, faculty, and staff to develop programs and services that enhance the quality of life at the university and foster a just and humane campus. Staff members also encourage students to develop ethically, intellectually, socially, and physically. Students learn to act responsibly at the campus level, while embracing leadership and involvement on and off campus. Crisis intervention is an important function of the Vice President for Student Affairs as well as staff members. Students who have personal or family problems are urged to contact the Student Affairs staff and communicate their needs or concerns. Their goal is to listen, intervene if appropriate, or refer the student to other resources. Students’ concerns remain confidential.</p>

<p>The Writing Resource Center (WRC) at Case Western Reserve University provides supplemental, discipline-specific writing instruction to students of all levels at the university. WRC writing consultants work one-on-one with students on a wide variety of projects. The WRC encourage visits from students at any stage of the writing process, from brainstorming and drafting, to revising and organizing, to sharpening expression. While the WRC also works with students on issues of mechanics and grammar, they are not a proofreading service. WRC consultants work collaboratively with students to assist them in becoming better writers.</p>
<p>The WRC will reopen during the second week of the Fall semester. During the Fall semester, consultants will offer campus writers both real-time online appointments and asynchronous writing review, or eTutoring.
