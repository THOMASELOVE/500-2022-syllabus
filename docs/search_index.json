"],["course-description.html", "Section 1 Course Description 1.1 Prerequisites 1.2 Everything is on the Web", " Section 1 Course Description PQHS 500 (cross-listed as CRSP 500) is a one-semester advanced course in modern design and analysis of observational studies, usually in the context of comparative effectiveness research, with a special emphasis on issues that arise in clinical and health services research. An observational study is an empirical investigation of treatments, policies or exposures and the effects that they cause, but it differs from an experiment in that the investigator cannot control the assignment of treatments to subjects. This course is designed to introduce design, data collection and analysis methods appropriate for scientists engaged in observational studies, and will prepare students to design and interpret their own studies, as well as those of others in their field. Technical formalities will be minimized, and the presentations will focus on the practical application of methods and strategies. 1.1 Prerequisites People take this course with a wide range of backgrounds and a common interest in using data effectively in research related to biology or medicine. All CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, regardless of their field of study or prior experience. Students with a working knowledge of R, multiple regression, and some familiarity with logistic regression, should be well prepared. I strongly encourage people to first complete the PQHS 431-432 sequence, or at least to be substantially familiar with the use of R and RStudio (as well as, ideally, R Markdown) on the coding side, and with multivariate regression modeling and in particular logistic regression on the statistical side. Those who are unsure if they are well prepared for the course should contact the instructor for some advice. 1.2 Everything is on the Web https://thomaselove.github.io/500 is the place to go for everything related to this course.

I am Thomas E. Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs. I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics. I direct Biostatistics and Data Science at the Population Health Research Institute and at the Center for Health Care Research and Policy at The MetroHealth System. For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for Better Health Partnership, an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there. I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching from CWRU. I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management. In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records. You may be interested in a recent study in Health Affairs showing the impact of a Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland. Or you might be interested in our New England Journal of Medicine study of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes. In 2011, James OMalley and I chaired the Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics, here in Cleveland. Heres a recap. Ive also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure. If you want to see a pretty complete list of my publications, knock yourself out. I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at Savant Systems, and we are raising two terrific sons. The elder lives and works in Pittsburgh and the younger is in his second year at Columbia University, my alma mater. We live in Shaker Heights. I sing and act occasionally in community theater. 2.2 Email Email to get help with the course: 500-help at case dot edu (seen by Professor Love and the TA, Wyatt Bensken) Thomas dot Love at case dot edu (for matters related to grades or individual concerns) Professor Love is available before and (especially) after class to chat. 2.3 Name and Pronouns Professor Love uses he/him/his pronouns.

Life is not OK right now. None of us are really okay. Were all just pretending. You most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased care responsibilities - you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you might be facing uncertain job prospects. Im fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your labs, do well on your essays and projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am somewhat flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency is intensified. If you tell me youre having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope youll extend me the same grace. You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that youre going through, though. If I cant help you myself, I may know somebody who can. If you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like youre behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to us! We will work with you. I promise. I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis. Thanks to Andrew Heiss for a lot of the better words here. 4.1 In case of emergency What if my situation changes (for any reason) during the semester? If you need to miss one session, or even two, just review the materials (including the recordings) and move on, and please feel encouraged to ask for help. If an emergency arises that will keep you from timely completion of a lab, essay, presentation or project, send an email directly to Dr. Love saying the following: I have an emergency that will keep me from completing (list things youre worried about completing) in a timely fashion. I will contact you again when I am able to make plans. Dr. Love will respond with OK and temporarily excuse you from things until you send a re-connection email to make plans for making up the work you missed, at which time hell evaluate the situation and together you can make that plan. At no time do you owe us any information about your health or the nature of the emergency.

Your deliverables include: a proposal which you will submit for my approval before proceeding further. an update verifying that you have the data and are proceeding appropriately. a final presentation to the class about your results accompanied by an abstract, and by R Markdown and HTML files that describe the work you did. Instructions and supplemental materials for the Course Project are available here. 5.3 An Observational Studies in Action presentation During the semester, you will be responsible for presenting the methods and results of an observational study from the literature that uses propensity scores. Your choice of manuscript must be accepted in advance by Dr. Love. After youve claimed a study, youll give a 15-minute presentation of it to the class, and youll also act as second reviewer for one of the studies selected by your colleagues. Instructions and supplemental materials for the OSIA work are available here. 5.4 Lab Assignments Several lab assignments require you to do some analyses (using R and R Markdown) on data we will provide to you. Details on the lab assignments are available here. 5.5 Essays in reaction to the course text In most sessions, we will be reading chapters from Paul Rosenbaums Observation and Experiment. Later in the term, well be asking you to produce brief essays after reading chapters from the book, to share with the rest of the class. The essay prompts are available here. 5.6 A Note on Feedback 500 is a very different course from 431-432 in terms of the hands on assistance that I make available to you as youre working on a lab, although Wyatt (our TA) will do his best to help you if you get stuck. In particular, Im not going to review your code to be sure youre going in the right direction, even though I understand some of you have come to expect that from 431-432. Instead, we discuss the homework in class and we provide a detailed answer sketch after the fact. So if you have questions, please feel free to send them to us at 500-help at case dot edu, or if youre more seriously stuck, use that email to arrange an office hour with Wyatt, but what I am likely to say to anything I cannot resolve quickly for you (or think is worthy of deeper discussion as a group) is: That sounds like an excellent question to bring up on Thursday in class, and Im going to let you (and everyone else) flounder a bit between now and our discussion of this homework in class. 5.7 Grading If you complete all deliverables on time, and your project and OSIA presentations are solid, you will receive an A in the course. If you mostly meet that standard but dont quite (either because more than one thing is late or because you have substantial project problems that linger), either an A or B is possible. This is an advanced graduate school course. I dont anticipate that anyone who makes a concerted effort will fall below the B standard, as no one has in the past.

So youll need to take advantage of every opportunity you have to write more effectively tomorrow than you do today. Heres what I find to be a compelling argument from George Cobb  If you want your work with data to make a difference, devote time and effort to choosing the words and pictures you use to present your evidence and conclusions. If you teach or supervise, seek to reward those - they who learn from you, and they who report to you  when they spend time crafting their message. Think back to the last report you were expected to read. Is it easy to recall the main points? The answer, yes or no, depends not so much on the quality of the data, the effort, and the thinking that went into the report, nor on your own dutiful diligence in reading the report, but rather, and mainly, on whether the people who wrote the report had learned and practiced the skills of how to use words and pictures, first, to claim attention, and second, to claim retention: to deliver a message that sticks in the mind. 7.1 Campus Resources The University Resources for Student Support section in this Syllabus lists several important resources for improving your English and your communication skills, most of which will be available remotely after the first week of the semester.

RStudio has a spell-checker. To use it, click F7. Nothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables. Dont parrot back material that Professor Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in my words is, technically, plagiarism. Edit your more adventurous output; dont present everything you know how to do in R, and dont forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results. Make your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary. Clearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate. Simplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well. Data are plural. Use the data are  rather than ``the data is   A paragraph must contain more than one sentence. Dont switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout. Dont write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result. Similarly, dont defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in. If you want to write that you used \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval. If you find yourself in the appalling situation of writing about a p-value, then you should state something like: [1] Were using a 95% confidence level. [2] Were using a 5% significance level. [3] Were using \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Dont use more than one of these expressions. Again, dont use p-values in most settings, but if you must, refer to all p-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rather than, for instance, \\(p = 0.00000001\\) or, worse yet, \\(p = 0\\). In a similar vein, write all \\(p\\)-values that exceed 0.99 as \\(p &gt; 0.99\\) instead of, for instance, \\(p = 1\\). To the extent possible, dont use computer-ese to label variables, plots or tables. R and Markdown allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things  do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage. When in doubt, err on the side of clarity. Clear thinking, clear writing.
